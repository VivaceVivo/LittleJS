# LittleJS

Experiments wirh morphic.js - maybe resulting in some sort of audio editor, but I make no promises.

## Note

To try, put blocks.js, gui.js, morphic.js, threads.js, byob.js, objects.js, and  widgets.js from Snap! into the js directory. ( https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks )
